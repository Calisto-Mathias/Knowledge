This semester has to be a huge comeback for Sakshi. Owing to the previous calculations on [[Semester - 3#^bd62c1|Predicted CGPA]]. 

Pinning that here for quick reference:
- Worst Case Scenario: 7.655 (*467 points*)
- Best Case Scenario: 7.721 (*468 points*)

Sakshi's target goals by the end of the [[Semester - 5|Fifth Semester]] is to reach a minimum of 8.5 CGPA and hopefully better.
# Grade Point Prediction
- Total Credits: 20 
- Total Number of Courses: 5 

If Sakshi gets a **9.6 SGPA** in this semester, then she would be able to boost her CGPA to **8.135**. This would be a huge jump and quite impressive as well. She is fully capable of doing it. She just needs to have the right headspace to be able to focus. She is more than capable of scoring this. And I know that. I don't know how I know that but I do. I don't think she is ever going to read this so it's fine.
