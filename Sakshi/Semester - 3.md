This wasn't the best semester for Sakshi but she will do better in the next semester. These calculations below are so that a nice plan can be created for the 4th semester as to what different grade points next semester will make her reach her reach her goal. She is studying really hard so I'm sure it will happen. Have to make it happen anyways :))

## Predictions for SGPA
- Worst Case Scenario: 7.33 (*154 points*)
- Best Case Scenario: 7.52 (*158 points*)
## Predictions for CGPA
^bd62c1
- Worst Case Scenario: 7.655 (*467 points*)
- Best Case Scenario: 7.721 (*468 points*)

In the current situation, these are actually pretty good scores overall for her third semester. She had a lot of stuff going on. But I'm confident she is going to make a huge comeback in the fourth semester. I will make sure she does. I don't know how but I will.
