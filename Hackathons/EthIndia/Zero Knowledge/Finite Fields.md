Finite fields are simply a set of elements such that 2 operations - addition and multiplication are defined on them:
1. Addition: It is a closed operation which generates another element in the set
2. Multiplication: It is also a closed operation which generates another element in the set
There are also some basic rules that must be followed. 
1. An additive identity must exist in the set such that addition of any element with this additive identity results in the same element itself.
2. A multiplicative identity must also exist in the set such that the multiplication of any element with this multiplicative identity results in the same element itself.
3. A multiplicative inverse must also exist.
