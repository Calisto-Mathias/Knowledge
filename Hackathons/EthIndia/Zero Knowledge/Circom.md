Circom is used in order to generate the Rank 1 Constraint System which can then be combined with Snark.JS in order to generate zero knowledge proofs. 
# Writing Circuits
The signals show that there are a whole list of circuits. Each gate provides a constraint defined by the gate itself. In this case, the gates are addition, and multiplication modulo the prime p of the Finite field $F_p$.
# Assignment Operators
<-- is used simply as a direct assignment operator to the signals
<== specifies a constraint system.
