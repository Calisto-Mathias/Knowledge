# Computer Types

The types of computers are there of many types. It is very important to understand the point behind having each type of computer.

## Embedded Computers

Embedded computers are computers that are much smaller than the regular portable computers or personal computers. They are programmed for a single purpose and cannot be reprogrammed as their program is embedded into the circuitry most of the time. 

Even if this is not the case, the memory is READ-ONLY and can't be overwritten without highly specialized equipment.

These kinds of computers are used in household appliances, as well as sensors, etc. The computer that is used in order to control the execution of a washing machine in your home would also be done using an embedded system.

## Personal Computers

These are just the regular computers that are available to the general public in current situations. They support a variety of applications such as general computation, document preparation, and the regular applications that a personal computer uses.

## Servers

These are larger computers that are designed in order to be accessed by more than a single user at the same time. 

# Functional Units

A computer consists of five functionally independent main parts

1. Input Units
2. Memory
3. Arithmetic and Logic Units
4. Output Units
5. Control Units

## Memory Unit

### Primary Memory

This is also known as the main memory. It works at electronic speeds. It stores data in the form of words. It's not usually possible to read and write individual cells of bytes. Rather, you can read and write entire words. 

If it is possible to access any word in the same time, then it is known as random access memory. 

## Cache Memory

Instructions and data are fetched and stored in the cache memory. If it is required, then they can be read faster through the cache memory than to go and retrieve it from the main memory. 

# Registers In The Processor

The instruction register holds the instruction that is currently being executed. Its output is available to the control circuits. 

There are some specialized registers in the processor such as

1. Program Counter
2. Instruction Register

Then there are $n$ general purpose registers as well.
