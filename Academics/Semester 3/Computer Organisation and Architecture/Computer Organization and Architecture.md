## Concepts
1. [[Basic Structure of Computers]]
2. [[Instruction Set Architecture]]
3. [[Basic Processing Unit]]
4. [[Virtual Memory]]
5. [[Pipelining]]: A method in increasing the speed and efficiency of the execution of instructions on a processor without having to increase the actual speed of execution of each stage of the processor.
	1. Consists of breaking down the process of executing an instruction into different stages
	2. Increases the throughput of instruction execution rather than speed of execution of an independent instruction
	3. Hazards are stalls in a pipeline caused due to delay in the execution of a stage, or any other reasons such as branching, cache misses, etc, or even access to the same hardware resource.
