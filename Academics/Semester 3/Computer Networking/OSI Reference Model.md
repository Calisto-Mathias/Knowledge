The OSI Reference model is one of the main network architectures that is used as a reference to build network software. Although it is not as widely used as the [[TCP/IP Model]].

The OSI Model is quite ***General***.

OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has ***7*** layers 

# Layers of the OSI Model

There are 7 Layers when it comes to the OSI model. These are:

1. [[Physical Layer]] - Concerned with transmitting raw bits
2. [[Data Link Layer]] - Transform Raw Transmission Channel Into a line that appears free from errors.
3. [[Network Layer]] 
4. [[Transport Layer]] - The basic idea of the transport layer is to accept data from above it, split it into smaller chunks, and pass these into the network layer, while also making sure that they are received in the right order.
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer
