# Frequency Division Multiplexing

A guard band keeps the frequency division multiplexed channels properly separated. Even though guard bands exist, there can still be slight overlap between two or more frequency divisions. This is mostly because filters aren't sharp!

Frequency division multiplexing continues to be used in telephone networks, as well as cellular, terrestrial wireless, and other wireless bands.

### Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is used by 5G networks. It does not need to make use of any guard bands. This is done only when it is needed to send digital data.

# Time Division Multiplexing

Users take turns (in a round-robin fashion) where each user gets access to the channel for short bursts of time. There is also some guard time that is added in between each switch of a user in order to account for any small time variations.

> Statistical Time Division Multiplexing is also known as packet switching!
