The data link layer is the second layer in the OSI standard layers. It is of very great importance and provides a lot of services as well as an interface to the Network Layers.

# What Is The Purpose Of The Data Link Layer?

The data link layer is primarily concerned with:

1. Achieving reliable, efficient communication of whole units of information called ***Frames***

This might seem like something that's really small but it actually includes a lot of small nuances that you won't realize at first.

Some of the main issues that come with data channels is that:

1. While transferring a bit of data, it can be flipped from a 1 to a 0 or from a 0 to a 1
2. Each channel only has a finite data rate. It is up to the Data Link Layer.

# Services Provided By The Data Link Layer To The Network Layer

The data link layer provides the main purpose of transferring data from the network layer on one machine to the network layer on another host machine. 

There are three main types of services that the data link layer provides to the Network Layer

1. Unacknowledged Connectionless Service (Such as Ethernet)
2. Acknowledged Connectionless Service
3. Acknowledge Connection-Oriented Service
