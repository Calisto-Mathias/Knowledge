A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. That is why a table in the relational model is known as a relation while a row is known as a tuple. 
For each attribute of a relation, we have a permitted set of values that is called the domain of the attribute.

We use the term relation instance for a particular instance of a relation, i.e, a specific set of rows in the relation (table).

We need a way in order to uniquely identify a tuple from the value of its attributes.
