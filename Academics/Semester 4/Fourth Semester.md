This semester is a pretty heavy semester. It consists of a total of **20** credits split amongst 5 courses. 
# Courses
[[Compiler Design]]
[[Operating Systems]]
[[Data Structures and Algorithms - 2]]
[[Database Design]]

Each course is a 4-pointer course and contains a lab. The marks split is unknown for now but we will definitely get to know in a while. It consists of 2 subjects **that are my absolute favorite!**. Time to ace them. 

Last semester went good by luck but it isn't always going to be that way. You aren't going to get lucky all the time. Time to study hard this semester. The aim is to push up your grade-point by at least a 0.1. 
# Targets
- SGPA: **9.8+**
I know this SGPA might seem like too much but without aiming for so high, I won't be able to get anywhere. It's all in the mind. And honestly why not? I haven't been trying hard enough.

This is a test. This is another test. This is the last test. Hehe. Finally this works. The setup at night finaly worked. Thank god. It would have been so pissing off if this didn't work. But now I think it will work regardless. Hopefully it doesn't just stop working randomly. So like yeah :)

I also hope you are not annoyed :(( Cuz this took a while :)) But yessss you won't need to edit anythign more now.
