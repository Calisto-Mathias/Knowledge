# Alphabets
An alphabet is a finite, non-empty set of symbols.
# Strings
A string is a finite sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet.
## Empty String
The empty string is the string with zero occurrences of a symbol. It is denoted by $\epsilon$
## Length of a String
The length of a string $w$ is denoted by $|w|$.
# Power of an Alphabet
$\sum^k$ is used to denote the set consisting of all strings whose length is $k$.
$\sum^*$ is used to denote the set of all strings over an alphabet $\sum$. Moreover, $\sum^+$ is used to denote all non-empty strings over an alphabet $\sum$.
# Concatenation of Strings
let $x$ and $y$ be two strings over some alphabet $\sum$. Then $xy$ is the concatenation of these two strings.
