A "Non-Deterministic" finite automaton has the *the power to be in multiple states at once*. 
# Definition
A Non-Deterministic finite automaton A consists of the following:
1. It has a finite set of states $Q$.
2. It has an initial starting state $q_0 \in Q$
3. It has a finite set of input symbols $\sum$
4. It has a finite set of final states $F \s
