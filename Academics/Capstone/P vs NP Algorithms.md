 There are basically two types of algorithms
 1. Deterministic Algorithms
 2. Non-Deterministic Algorithms

P-Algorithms are the deterministic algorithms that have been solved in polynomial time.

NP-Algorithms are the non-deterministic algorithms that are in polynomial time.

Satisfiability problem is considered to be the base case for the other problems.

If any NP-hard problem is solved, then every other NP-hard problem is also solved.
