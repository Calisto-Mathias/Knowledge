 A fundamental theory of arithmetic is that
 > Every number can be written as a product of primes.

Let $a$ be an integer and $b$ be a positive integer, then there exist unique integers q and r such that 
$$a = b \cdot q + r$$
This is basically just the remainder theorem. Furthermore, given the values a and b, it is possible to compute the values of q and r in polynomial time.

The binary length of any integer is given by
$$||N|| = \text{floor}(log_2 N) + 1$$
