This is also known as **symmetric-key cryptography**.

Perfect secrecy is usually very limited and not very useful in general. In this sense, it is important to study the idea of **computational security**. This underlies most of the world's modern day cryptography.
# Computational Security
Perfect secrecy demands that absolutely no information should be leaked out to any eavesdropper with an unbounded computational power. 

Computational Security on the other hand demands that an encryption scheme would be considered secure if it leaked out only a little information about the en
