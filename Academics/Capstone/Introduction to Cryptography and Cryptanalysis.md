# The Setting of Private Key Encryption
There are two types of encryption in general - Symmetric Key Encryption and Asymmetric Key Encryption. 
# Syntax of Encryption
Formally, a private key encryption scheme is defined by specifying a message space $M$ along with three algorithms
1. The Key Generation Algorithm
2. The Encryption Algorithm
3. The Decryption Algorithm
## Key Generation Algorithm
