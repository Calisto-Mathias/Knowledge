# Caesar Cipher
We just rotate the characters by 3 letters front. This would be a simple cipher which makes use of no key. 
# Sufficient Key-Space Principle:
The sufficient key-space principle indicates that
> Any secure encryption scheme must have a key space that is sufficiently large to make a brute force search possible.
# Principles of Modern Cryptography
