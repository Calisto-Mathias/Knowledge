# What are Block Ciphers?
They are supposed to be secure instantiations of strong [[Pseudo-random Generators#^b19181|Pseudo Random Permutations]] except that we fix the key length and the block length.
## What are Strong Pseudo Random Permutations?
[[Pseudo-random Generators#^617895|Pseudo Random Permutations]] are simply just semantically secure 
bijective functions (one-one and onto). When the pseudo-random permutation is both
