Reference models allow for devices to interconnect and talk to each other so that they all follow the same "rules" or "technologies" while trying to interconnect.

The obvious winner in what is actually implemented is the TCP/IP model which is what is installed in most systems but network engineers always talk in terms of the OSI model as well.
