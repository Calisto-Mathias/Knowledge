Reference models allow for devices to interconnect and talk to each other so that they all follow the same "rules" or "technologies" while trying to interconnect.

The obvious winner in what is actually implemented is the TCP/IP model which is what is installed in most systems but network engineers always talk in terms of the OSI model as well.
# Why is the OSI Model Important?
The OSI model is an amazing reference model that lets two computers interconnect and inter-communicate using the same standards. This ensures that even if different manufacturers are creating the hardware, they will still be able to connect to each other.

We have 7 different layers in the OSI Model. These are (from bottom to top):
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer
# Different Layers of a Network
1. Backbone Layer
2. Distribution Layer
3. Access Layer
