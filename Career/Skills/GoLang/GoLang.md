Go was meant to be a language that was fast to compile and fast to run that was created by Google when it was facing issues for the same reason.

It also comes with quite a bit of formatting built into its syntax itself - which basically implies that if you don't follow the formatting rules, then it violates the compile-time syntax check.
# Data Types
## Literals
Literals are **untyped** but every literal does have a default type that it defaults to in case its type cannot be inferred.

We have all the sized integer types such as
- `int8`
- `int16`
- `int32`
- `int64`
- `uint8`
- `uint16`
- `uint32`
- `uint64`

Go also has built in support for complex numbers though this is more of an esoteric feature.
# Functions in Go Lang
- Functions required typed arguments
- There is support for variadic arguments
- Functions in Go can support multiple return values that have to be separated by commas.
