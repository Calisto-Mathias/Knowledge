JavaScript has three very commonly used primitive types
1. ```string```
2. `number`
3. `boolean`

In TypeScript, there are also the types `String, Boolean, Number` which are also perfectly legal types but these are different from `string, boolean, number`. It is always better to make use of the first ones as these are the default ones that are made use of in most use-cases. 

Typescript has a lot of **contextual type-inference**. 
# Union Types
A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may by any one of those types. Its sort of like the **OR** operator.
