JavaScript has three very commonly used primitive types
1. ```string```
2. `number`
3. `boolean`

In TypeScript, there are also the types `String, Boolean, Number` which are also perfectly legal types but these are different from `string, boolean, number`. It is always better to make use of the first ones as these are the default ones that are made use of in most use-cases.
