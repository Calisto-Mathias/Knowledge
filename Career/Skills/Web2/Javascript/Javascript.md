JavaScript is a Just-In-Time compiled language. This makes it pretty well-performing in most cases. 
# JavaScript Objects
A JavaScript object is simply made up of many key-value pairs. In that sense, it is simply just a Hashmap.
## Object Prototypes
Prototypes are the mechanisms in JavaScript by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. 

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. If an object's property is not found in itself, then it is searched for in its prototype object.

In JS, we can use a function as a constructor for an object. When we do this, the function's prototype property is set as the new object's property.
