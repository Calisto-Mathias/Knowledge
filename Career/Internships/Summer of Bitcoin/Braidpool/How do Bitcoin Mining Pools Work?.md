Mining pools allow bitcoin miners in order to pool together their computation powers and hashing power in order to mine blocks for the bitcoin blockchain. They do come with their pros and cons though.

# General Considerations for a Decentralized Bitcoin Mining Pool
There are mainly 5 main components in a decentralized mining pool

1. Weak Blocks
2. Consensus Mechanism 
3. Payout Commitments 
4. Signing Procedure
5. Transaction Selection Procedure for building bitcoin blocks

In general, in a decentralized bitcoin mining pool, there must be some additional structure that shows that this share belongs to the mining pool itself. This must be done using some additional metadata that must be committed.

# PHANTOM Protocol
The Phantom protocol is a protocol that generalizes the Nakamoto consensus to Directed Acyclic Graphs.
