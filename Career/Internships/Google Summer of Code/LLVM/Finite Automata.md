A finite automata is another way of representing a regular expression. Epsilon moves are moves from one state to another state without consuming any input.

The epsilon closure of any state is the set of states that can be reached from the current state with an epsilon move. 
# How to convert Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton to Deterministic Finite Automaton
A non-deterministic finite automaton consists of:
1. A set of states S
2. A starting state S
3. A final set of States which is a subset of the total possible sets.
