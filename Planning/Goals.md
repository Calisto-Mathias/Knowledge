# Academic Goals
Semester 3 wasn't the best semester. It's time to seriously lock in and try to increase your grade point. 
## 1. Score 9.5+ SGPA in Semester 4
Currently, your [[Third Semester]] hasn't been the best semester of college. The worst case expected SGPA of this semester stands at **8.8** which would bring my overall CGPA down to **9.21**. 
### Credits vs Semester Chart
- Semester 1: 187 (9.35 SGPA * 20 Credits)
- Semester 2: 190 (9.5 SGPA * 20 Credits)
- Semester 3: *expected: 185* (8.8 SGPA * 21 Credits)
This puts your overall SGPA at **9.21**. [[Fourth Semester]] will have a total of 20 credits, which puts it at nearly 25% of the overall CGPA at the end of the [[Fourth Semester]]. I need a minimum of 188 credits to push up my grade point. This means that the minimum SGPA that I need to push the grade point up would be **9.4**. 

The plan of this is in [[Fourth Semester]].
## 2. Finish The Capstone Project Courses
The [[Capstone Project]] is also ongoing and you have a lot of things to complete. Make a proper planner in [[Capstone Project]] and a timetable in [[Capstone Project]].
